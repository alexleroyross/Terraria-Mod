A general Terraria mod being made by me.

Coded by me.
IMPORTANT: This code is based off of code in ExampleMod, which is a sample mod provided with tModLoader.  It, along with tModLoader itself, was made by blushiemagic.  I didn't code any of this stuff.  I'm only including it in my repository to make it easier for me to access good code to model my own after.  Eventually, I will extrapolate my own code from the rest of ExampleMod so that I can have my own standalone mod.

Here's the Terraria forum link for tModLoader:  https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/1-3-tmodloader-a-modding-api.23726/

Graphics drawn (by me) using:
- Paint.NET: http://www.getpaint.net/
IMPORTANT: Again, the graphics that came with ExampleMod are included in this repository for right now.  Credit for all of these goes to blushiemagic (see above link).

Music credits:
- Starship Zone:  "Funky Moles & Trashy Ducks", a Darkwing Duck remix made by timaeus222 on OverClocked Remix ( http://ocremix.org ).  The remix can be found here: https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR03005
IMPORTANT: ExampleMod came with a few sounds as well.  Credit for all of these also goes to blushiemagic.

I think I included everything.  If I forgot something, its credit probably goes to blushiemagic (again, see above link for the Terraria forum post).
